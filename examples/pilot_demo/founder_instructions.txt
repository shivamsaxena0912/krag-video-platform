HOW TO REVIEW YOUR VIDEO
========================================

Hi Alice,

Here's how to review the video we've created for you and give us feedback.


STEP 1: WATCH THE VIDEO
----------------------------------------

Open the video file (final_video.mp4) in your review pack folder.
Watch it all the way through at least once without stopping.

Pro tip: Watch it on the device your audience will use.
If it's for Instagram, watch on your phone.


STEP 2: READ THE MARKETING SUMMARY
----------------------------------------

Open marketing_summary.txt to see:
  - Who this video is for
  - What action we want viewers to take
  - Key points the video covers

Does this match what you had in mind?


STEP 3: CHECK THE DIRECTOR NOTES (OPTIONAL)
----------------------------------------

If you're curious why we made certain creative choices,
director_notes.txt explains our thinking.

This is optional - you don't need to read it to give feedback.


STEP 4: GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK
----------------------------------------

Reply with one of these three responses:

  APPROVE
  --------
  "This is ready to publish."
  We're done! You can use this video.

  MINOR CHANGES
  -------------
  "I like it, but please adjust..."
  Tell us specific small changes. Examples:
    - "The opening is too slow"
    - "Can you make it 5 seconds shorter?"
    - "The ending needs a stronger call-to-action"

  MAJOR CHANGES
  -------------
  "This doesn't work for me because..."
  Tell us what's fundamentally wrong. Examples:
    - "The tone is too serious, we're a playful brand"
    - "This misses our key message entirely"
    - "This doesn't feel like our company"


WHAT MAKES GOOD FEEDBACK
----------------------------------------

  Good: "The video feels too slow in the middle section"
  Bad:  "I don't like it"

  Good: "Our key message about pricing isn't clear enough"
  Bad:  "It needs to be better"

  Good: "The ending should say 'Start your free trial' more prominently"
  Bad:  "Fix the ending"

The more specific you are, the faster we can make it right.
