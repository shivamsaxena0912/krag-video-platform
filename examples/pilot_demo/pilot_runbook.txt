PILOT RUNBOOK
============================================================

Pilot ID:     pilot_20240115_abc12345
Founder:      Alice Chen
Company:      AcmeAI
Scenario:     feature_launch
Created:      2024-01-15 09:30 UTC

------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WE ARE TESTING
------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Goal:
  Validate video generation quality for real founder use case

Secondary Goals:
  - Measure time-to-first-cut for this scenario type
  - Identify common feedback patterns for playbook improvement
  - Validate SLA constraints for the target platform

------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
------------------------------------------------------------

  [_] Founder approves at least one video for publishing
  [_] Time-to-first-cut under 2 minutes
  [_] No more than 3 iterations needed for approval
  [_] SLA constraints met (duration, shot count, pacing)

------------------------------------------------------------
ITERATION LIMITS
------------------------------------------------------------

  Maximum video attempts:         5
  Max iterations per attempt:     3
  Total possible iterations:      15

  If we hit these limits without approval, we will:
    1. Analyze feedback patterns
    2. Update our playbook
    3. Discuss next steps with founder

------------------------------------------------------------
FEEDBACK WE WANT FROM THE FOUNDER
------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Overall video quality and professionalism
  2. Pacing - too fast, too slow, or just right
  3. Hook effectiveness - does it grab attention?
  4. Ending clarity - is the call-to-action clear?
  5. Tone alignment - does it match the brand voice?
  6. Key message - does the main point come through?

  Feedback format:
    - APPROVE: Ready to publish as-is
    - MINOR CHANGES: Small tweaks needed (specify what)
    - MAJOR CHANGES: Significant rework needed (specify issues)

------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WE PROMISE
------------------------------------------------------------

  [x] Up to 5 video attempts
  [x] Up to 3 refinement iterations per attempt
  [x] Review pack with each video for easy feedback
  [x] Plain-English marketing summary (no jargon)
  [x] Director notes explaining creative decisions
  [x] Response to feedback within 24 hours

------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WE DON'T PROMISE
------------------------------------------------------------

  [ ] Final production-quality video (this is draft quality)
  [ ] Custom music or voice-over (using placeholders)
  [ ] Unlimited revisions (we have defined limits)
  [ ] Guaranteed approval (we're testing, not selling)
  [ ] Timeline commitments (this is a pilot)

------------------------------------------------------------
PILOT TIMELINE
------------------------------------------------------------

  Day 1:    Initial video generation
  Day 1-2:  Founder review and feedback
  Day 2-3:  Iterations based on feedback
  Day 3-5:  Final approval or decision to stop

  Note: Timeline is approximate and depends on founder availability.
